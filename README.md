# Work Tagger
### A Labelling Companion



Work Tagger is a web-based tool that facilitates the classification of AWT data. Work Tagger has been developed using Streamlit, which is an open-source Python framework to create interactive web-applications, whose main characteristic is that it integrates the development of both a web-based frontend and backend into a single Python code base.

Work Tagger is designed to use the AWT data collected by an application called Tockler, which records all active windows on the computer while the application is installed and running. We have chosen Tockler because it is open source and runs locally, which helps to avoid privacy concerns. However, Work Tagger is designed to easily integrate data coming from other similar tools.
