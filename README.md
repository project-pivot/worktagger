Work Tagger is a web-based tool that facilitates the classification of AWT data. Work Tagger has been developed using Streamlit, which is an open-source Python framework to create interactive web-applications, whose main characteristic is that it integrates the development of both a web-based frontend and backend into a single Python code base.

Work Tagger is designed to use the AWT data collected by an application called Tockler, which records all active windows on the computer while the application is installed and running. We have chosen Tockler because it is open source and runs locally, which helps to avoid privacy concerns. However, Work Tagger is designed to easily integrate data coming from other similar tools.

The web-based user interface of Work Tagger allows users to upload files, select data for classification, and visualize the results using different views. The user interface is designed to be user-friendly and interactive, featuring dynamic UI elements such as buttons, select boxes and sliders for ease of use. Streamlit's interactive widgets enhance user experience by providing responsive and intuitive controls.

Once users upload their AWT logs (in csv format) through the user interface, the backend processes these files, converting them into a dataframe. During this process, columns are prepared with the necessary formats for efficient data manipulation.

In contrast to other web-based tools, Work Tagger does not use a database for data storage. Instead, Work Tagger relies on session state variables to store data temporarily. This approach ensures that each user's data is isolated and managed independently, preventing conflicts in a multi-user environment. These session state variables are maintained for the duration of the user's interaction with the application, ensuring a personalized and consistent experience. Additionally, this decision is related to privacy concerns, we do not store records of individuals' computer usage, thus protecting users' personal information and ensuring their privacy.

When the AWT log is loaded in the application, Work Tagger displays the AWT events in a table and allows the user to label the events with the activity and case the user was performing at that moment. For activities, the user may opt to undertake the classification process either manually or automatically. In the former case, the user has to choose the activity from a predefined list of activities and subactivities based on the one used in ~\cite{beerepoot2023window} for academic work activities. However, Work Tagger is designed so that the set of activities can be easily modified. In the latter case, once automatic classification is initiated, the backend logic sends the data to the classification core to interact with the OpenAI API to perform zero-shot classification using the GPT-4o model based on the same set of activities and subactivities used in the manual classification. We opted for this approach to provide a highly flexible and adaptive classification system that does not require training the model beforehand.

Concerning the labeling of cases, only manual labeling is possible. Moreover, unlike activities, the set of cases are open and users can pick from case labels already used in the dataset or can enter new case labels. The reason for following a different approach for cases is because, unlike activities, they are very specific to a particular person and a particular moment in time.
